Programs for MSc Physics of Kannur University
Some programs would require you to use a numerical integration technique like the Verlet algorithm. Install SFML library to create a graphical simulation. You'll need to install the SFML library before running those codes. You can find instructions on how to install SFML here: https://www.sfml-dev.org/tutorials/2.5/start-cb.php
